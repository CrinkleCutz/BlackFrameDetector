# Project Rules for Claude Code

## Critical: Always Check NOTES First
Before starting ANY task, you MUST:
1. `cat NOTES/errors.md` - Review active issues
2. `cat NOTES/fixes.md` - Check recent solutions
3. `cat NOTES/decisions.md` - Understand context

## Error Handling Protocol
When an error occurs:
1. Append to NOTES/errors.md immediately:
   - Date, component, exact error message
   - Status: Open
2. Document the fix in NOTES/fixes.md once resolved
3. Update status in errors.md to Fixed

## Decision Logging
For architectural choices, log in NOTES/decisions.md:
- What was decided
- Why (rationale)
- What else was considered
- Trade-offs accepted

## File Structure
NOTES/
├── errors.md          # Active and resolved issues
├── fixes.md           # Solutions and workarounds
├── decisions.md       # Technical decisions
└── YYYY-MM-DD_*.md    # Detailed issue tracking (optional)
